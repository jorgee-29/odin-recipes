    </p>

    <p>Makes 2 servings (2 pancakes) | Prep Time: 5 min. | Cook Time: 8 min.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>2 cup egg whites</li>
      <li>4 slices regular ass white bread (up to 80 calories per slice)</li>
      <li>4 packets of sweetener</li>
      <li>2 tsp cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1.5 tsp guar/xanthan gum</li>
      <li>100g blueberries</li>
      <li>0.5 cup low calorie syrup</li>
      <li>Cooking spray</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>In a blender, add bread slices, egg whites, guar/xantham gum, sweetener, vanilla extract,
        and cinnamon.</li>
      <li>Blend on high until mixture is uniform in consistency. Remove mix from the blender
        and add to a fridge-safe airtight container</li>
      <li>(OPTIONAL): Let sit for 2-3 hours or more in the refrigerator. The longer you let
        the mixture rest, the better it binds. (Note: it <em>can</em> be cooked right away but itâ€™s
        better if it has time to sit).</li>
      <li>Heat a griddle over low-medium heat. Spray griddle with cooking spray. Add mixture to griddle and
        let sit for 1-2 minutes until edges appear cooked through.</li>
      <li>Add blueberries to the pancake in the griddle.</li>
      <li>Once edges start to brown and pancake appears to be visibly cooked about 2/3 of the way,
        flip the pancake in the griddle and let sit another 1-2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Remove pancake from the griddle and serve on a plate with low calorie syrup or leftover
        blueberries.</li>
    </ol>
